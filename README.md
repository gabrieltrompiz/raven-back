## About this project

This project was developed for Software Engineering II subject, in 2018. The goal was to create any app from scratch, which involved going through the analysis of the software requirements; defining the architecture, components and characteristics of the system; the implementation and development of the app and the testing and quality assurance of the final product.

It's a mobile app that allows the users to communicate in real-time, and would be available for any platform since it was developed using React Native.
